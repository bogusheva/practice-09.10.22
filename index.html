                  React Native is an open source framework for building Android
                  and iOS applications using React and the app platform&apos;s
                  native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to
                  access your platform&apos;s APIs as well as to describe the
                  appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
                  <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more
                  about React in the next section. But first, let&apos;s cover
                  how components work in React Native.

                  React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open
                  source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript.
                  To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React
                  itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a
                  refresher course.
                </p>
                <p>We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction
                  to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable
                  creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a
                  syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                  <mark> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt; </mark>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The React docs have
                  <a href="#">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to
                  learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use
                  variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
                  <mark>name</mark> for the cat, name, and embedding it with
                  curly braces inside
                  <mark>&lt;Text&gt;</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for
                  &quot;properties&quot;.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as
                  arguments you use to configure how components render, state is
                  like a component&apos;s personal data storage. State is useful
                  for handling data that changes over time or that comes from
                  user interaction. State gives your components memory!

              <h2>handling text input</h2>
              <sup>Chapter 4</sup>
              <div class="paragraphs-wrapper">
                <p>
                  TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter
                  text. It has an
                  <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be called
                  every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                  takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, let&apos;s say that as the user types,
                  you&apos;re translating their words into a different language.
                  In this new language, every single word is written the same
                  way: üçï. So the sentence &quot;Hello there Bob&quot; would be
                  translated as &quot;üçï üçï&quot;.
